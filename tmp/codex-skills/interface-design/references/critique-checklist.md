# Design Soul — Critique checklist

Use this to review an existing UI and propose the minimum changes that restore calm clarity.

## 1) Hierarchy & focus

- Is there exactly one primary action per view?
- Is the focal point obvious without relying on high contrast or saturated color?
- Does content lead the eye (headings, grouping, whitespace) more than UI chrome does?

## 2) Layout & spacing

- Are groups separated primarily by spacing (not constant dividers)?
- Are spacing steps consistent (no “almost the same” padding)?
- Do dense areas (tables/settings) still have breathing room?

## 3) Surfaces, borders, and depth

- Are surfaces warm (paper/linen), not sterile gray?
- Are borders hairline and warm, used to stabilize—not to segment everything?
- Is elevation rare and meaningful (popovers, active cards, primary composer)?
- Are shadows diffused and quiet (ambient light), never harsh?

## 4) Color usage

- Do accents feel like seasoning (mostly neutral screens)?
- Is the primary accent used sparingly and consistently for primary actions?
- Are link states discoverable beyond color alone (underline/weight)?
- Are success/warn/error colors gentle (not neon), but still clear?

## 5) Typography & copy tone

- Is text charcoal on warm surfaces (avoid harsh black-on-white)?
- Are body sizes and line heights comfortable (not “enterprise tight”)?
- Is the voice calm, confident, and sentence-case (avoid ALL CAPS)?

## 6) Components & states

- Do buttons feel “cushioned” (radius + padding) rather than boxed?
- Are inputs large and pill-like, with soft focus glow (not sharp blue)?
- Are hover/pressed states subtle (slight brighten/inset), not flashy?

## 7) Motion

- Are transitions understated (fade/short slide/subtle scale), not bouncy?
- Are loading indicators quiet (inline shimmer/pulse), not loud banners?

## 8) Accessibility

- Is text contrast sufficient and comfortable on warm neutrals?
- Is focus visible on all interactive elements (keyboard + screen reader users)?
- Are tap/click targets large enough and spacing prevents mis-taps?
